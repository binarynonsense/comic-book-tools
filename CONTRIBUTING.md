Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

For now, I'm not looking for code contributions, as I want to keep this as a personal project, but bug reports and feature suggestions are always welcome (you can use the [issues section](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/issues) of the repository to leave feedback).
