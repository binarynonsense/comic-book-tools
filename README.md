# ACBT - Comic Book Tools

ACBT - Command-line conversion and creation tools for comic book files (Windows & Linux).

This project is still in early development, lacking some of the functionality and testing required for a first stable release, and aims to be a stand-alone, command-line version of some of the tools available in ["ACBR - Comic Book Reader"](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader).
